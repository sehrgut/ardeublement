## TO DO

- EEPROM storage of parameters
- Rotary encoder and switch hardware interface
  - Optional potentiometer interface module
- SD card support, for modes with large amounts of static data
- MIDI clock in/out
- ToneRowComposer
- Euclidean rhythms
- loglevels

### MIDI scheduler
- priority queue of messages based on their intended tick time?
- abstract "pitch+duration" and "articulation" structs instead, from which messages are derived?
